# Student Performance Factors Statistical Analysis

This project explores the relationships between student demographics, study habits, and exam performance using a comprehensive educational dataset. Multiple statistical techniques are applied to derive insights into factors affecting student success.

## Project Objectives

- Investigate how factors like study hours, attendance, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities influence exam scores  
- Apply statistical models to assess differences in performance across demographic and behavioral groups  
- Use hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression, ANOVA, and bootstrapping  
- Visualize patterns and trends to support educational decision-making
